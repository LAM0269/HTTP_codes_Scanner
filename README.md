HTTP_codes_Scanner allows you to get the HTTP status code from a list of hosts to see/check if a web page is accessible.
 
It can be set to test HTTP or HTTPS, choose different ports than 80 and 443, follow or ignore redirects and ignore invalid security certificates.

USE : ./HTTP_codes_Scanner hosts.txt
